"""Count fuel into each hub from a fixed camera, fast enough to feed bioarena.

    python3 run.py hubfeed --source 0 --red 812,300,...  --blue 210,305,...

This is `experiments/area_hub_count.py` -- yellow area crossing a hand-drawn
outline of the funnel mouth -- turned from a batch script over a broadcast
into a live counter, because that is the only counter in this repository that
fits the bioarena feed's latency budget (spec 5.2: camera to count <= 80 ms
typical, 200 ms p99):

  * `count.BallCounter` holds every score 12 frames (400 ms at 30 fps) so a
    ball that passed over the hub can withdraw it. That hold alone is twice
    the p99 budget, and it needs the detector's tracks, which on a broadcast
    counted 0 balls (Einstein 4) and 19 of 74 (nhdur qm7).
  * The area counter needs no model and no long tracks. A blob is matched to
    the previous frame by position, and it counts on the frame its centre
    crosses the outline -- the "count at the plane" the spec asks for. The
    per-frame work is a colour gate on two small regions, a few milliseconds
    on a laptop CPU, so no GPU is needed and no frame queue builds up.

## What was measured, and what was not

On the 2026 Championship broadcast it counted 93% / 95% of the scoreboard on
Einstein 4, whose settings were fitted to it, and 120% / 137% blind on
Einstein 5 (see the experiment's docstring). It sees WHEN a hub scores --
flat in every inactive window -- and over-counts HOW MANY per burst.

A scrimmage camera is not a broadcast: closer, fixed, and set up for this. The
thresholds below are the experiment's, scaled by the one-ball area so they
keep their size relative to a ball; none has been checked at any other scale.
**Nothing here is validated on a practice-field camera.** The spec's
acceptance test -- twenty balls by hand-count against each tally, zero
disagreement -- is the first measurement, and until it passes the count must
not decide the AUTO winner (bioarena's "Counted" mode).

## Downward entries, one ball learned from the crossings

A funnel-mouth outline counts n when a blob crosses INTO it moving DOWN the
picture, and nothing when one crosses out. n is the blob's area over one
ball, and one ball is learned from the crossings themselves: the 30th
percentile of the last 80 crossing blobs, once 10 have been seen (before
that, the measured `ball_area`). Measured 2026-09-29 on Einstein 4, 5 and 1,
error against the scoreboard from the end of AUTO to the buzzer, settings
picked on two matches and scored on the third:

  the experiment's rules (signed, measured ball)     30% held-out mean
  these rules, blur 0.3                              13% (16% / 6% / 10%)

Why each rule:
- Balls crossing the mouth were 1.5-2.3x the measured still ball (motion
  blur, and the ball is nearer the camera at the rim than where it was
  measured), and the ratio differed per match: Einstein 1's AUTO had 85
  crossings for 85 real balls, but 56 of them were counted as two. Learning
  the size from the crossings takes the ratio out.
- The experiment counted outward crossings as -n. On Einstein 1 blue, 60-100 s
  had 161 entries and 171 exits against 108 real balls: balls bouncing about
  the hood, not scores coming back out. Up- and sideways-moving entries were
  the same kind of noise (a ball across the mouth, a bounce off the hood).
- n rounds up only at 0.65 of a ball: a blob of 1.5 balls' area is more
  often one blurred ball than two.

## Passes that clip the outline

A ball passed back to the alliance zone while the hub is active can fly
through the corner of a raised outline on its way down past the hub, and
the downward-entry rule counted it (seen 2026-10-06 replaying a California
Northern State Championship playoff match through Watchtower: passes beside
the hub scored). Such a ball is
taken back when the SAME track came in sideways and leaves the outline
sideways -- |vx| > |vy| both times -- and stays in sight outside for
PASS_CONFIRM_FRAMES more frames: it flew on, it did not drop into the hub. Exits that move up (a
bounce off the hood) or down (into the hub below the outline) leave the count
alone, as before, and so does a track that is lost after it leaves. Because
the feed never goes down, the ball is reported on entry as before -- the
latency is unchanged -- and taken back as `owed`, absorbed by the next ball
in. Measured 2026-10-07 with count_recording against the broadcasts' fuel
counters read every 8 s from the end of AUTO to the buzzer (19 checkpoints
a match), no guard -> sideways exit only -> sideways entry and exit:
Einstein 4 16.4 / 16.5 / 16.0%, 5 5.7 / 6.5 / 5.3%, 1 5.3 / 5.3 / 8.2%,
8 10.8 / 13.7 / 10.1%, Central Valley 26.6 / 16.4 / 17.0% (outlines
redrawn by eye; blue had counted 219 against 159). Einstein mean 9.5 /
10.5 / 9.9%, all five 13.0 / 11.7 / 11.3%, every AUTO winner right with
the guard (Einstein 1 was wrong without it, 101-98 against 95-96). The
exit-only rule took back real scores on Einstein 8 (red 532 -> 501 of
581); requiring a sideways entry too kept them. Chosen after seeing these
five, so not held out.

An exit line (`ExitLineCounter`) keeps the signed rule -- a ball across it
towards `out` is +1, one crossing back is -1 -- and the measured ball: the
broadcasts cannot see the exits well enough to test anything else.

The feed may never go down within a session (spec 4.2), so what is reported
is the high-water mark of the net count. `owed` in the status line is how
many signed exits, or passes taken back, are being absorbed by later entries.

    same balls from different angles and the one that missed fewest is
    taken. `median`: three or more see the same balls and the odd one out is
    outvoted. Each zone's own count never goes down, and a sum, a max and an
    order statistic of non-decreasing counts never go down either, so the
    combined count keeps the feed's rule. An even number of zones under
    `median` takes the lower middle one.

    A hub with both outlines and exit lines combines each kind as above,
    then takes the larger of the two: a scored ball crosses the outline on
    the way in and the exit on the way out, so adding them counts it twice.
    On Central Valley (2026-10-07, exits in view) outline + exit summed to
    29.9% error against 17.0% for the outline alone, the mean of the two was
    37.0%, and the larger was 17.0% -- the exits there caught 17 of 159 and
    83 of 810 (balls pile at the exit). The larger keeps each kind as a
    floor for the other: an exit camera aimed at a chute that counts more

    every frame it counted, for a live preview; it must return at once.
