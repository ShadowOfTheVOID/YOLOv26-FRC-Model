"""The trained fuel model as a second hub counter, blended with the colour one.

The colour counter (hubcount.CrossingCounter) over-counts: on Einstein 1 it
read 99% / 117% of the official totals at the buzzer, because balls that clip
the rim and drop behind the hub look like scores from in front. The model
counter (detections on a crop around the hub -> trackvis.BallTracker ->
count.BallCounter) under-counts the other way, 81% / 103%, because the
tracker loses balls fired in streams. They fail on different balls, so a
weighted mean of the two is nearer than either: on Einstein 1, the one
Einstein match fuel_relabel.pt never trained on, colour alone was 9.1% mean
error against the official checkpoints, the model alone 12.1%, the mean of
the two 7.8% (CHANGELOG, 2026-10-02).

Both halves are cumulative and never go down, so a weighted mean of them,
rounded, never goes down either -- the feed's rule holds.

The model half is slower to report: BallCounter confirms a score only after
the ball has been gone `vanish` frames and nothing has reappeared near it for
`reacquire` frames. Half of every ball therefore arrives that much later than
the colour half; DEFAULT_MODEL holds the hold to what the tuning measured.

`ModelCounter` is pure state (no torch, no OpenCV) so it is tested without a
model; `ModelEye` runs the network and needs requirements-detect.txt.
