"""Draw a model's tracks on a video: small labels, trails, and gaps bridged.

    python3 run.py track --weights models/fuel_best.pt --source match.mp4

What `YOLO(...).predict(save=True)` drew was a "fuel 0.85" label on every one
of ~300 balls a frame, which buried the picture, and no tracking at all. This
tracks with `fuel_track.yaml`, draws thin boxes with at most a small id, and
a trail behind each moving ball.

A ball fades at the top of its arc -- it slows, it is small, it is against
the crowd -- and the detector drops it for a few frames. `Coaster` keeps
drawing it where its last motion says it is, as a hollow circle, for up to
`coast` frames, so a flight reads as one flight. It is display only: nothing
is counted from a coasted position.

Streams frame by frame, so a whole match cannot run the machine out of
memory the way predict(..., save=True) without stream=True did.

    ByteTrack (fuel_track.yaml) links a detection to a track by how much its

    turning over at the top of its arc slows, stops and falls: the
    prediction and the ball stop overlapping, and the track breaks. On 4 s of
    Einstein 4, 19 of 20 flights ByteTrack lost while rising or at the top
    still had a detection of confidence 0.1-0.8 right where the ball was in
    the following frames -- the detector saw it; the linking dropped it --
    and only 1 of 25 flying tracks got through its apex.

    This predicts each track from its last velocity and takes the nearest
    detection within a gate that grows with the ball's size, its speed and
    how long it has been missing. Confident detections (>= `start_conf`)
    may start a track; weaker ones may only continue one, the same rule
    ByteTrack's second association uses. Pure Python: tested without a model.
