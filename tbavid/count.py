"""Count scored fuel from the detector alone. No scoreboard, no OCR.

Everything else that produces a fuel number in this repository reads the
broadcast's burned-in counter. That is the right answer when there IS one:
it is the field's own arithmetic, and no vision system beats it.

It is no answer at all on a field that does not render one -- a practice field,
an offseason event, a demo, somebody's own game system. There the only
statement of what scored is the ball going in, and the detector already has a
`fuel` class and a hub for each alliance. This counts the event itself.

    python3 run.py count --weights runs/<name>/weights/best.pt --source 0

## What counts as a score

A ball that goes into the hub stops being visible. So the event this looks for
is a fuel track **vanishing inside a hub region** -- and almost all of the work
here is refusing the three other things that look exactly like that:

  * **A one-frame blob.** A false detection appears and is gone. Rejected by
    `min_track_frames`: a ball that was really there was there for a while.
  * **A ball a robot drove in front of.** It vanishes, and it happens to be
    near the hub. Rejected by `require_entry`: a scored ball crossed INTO the
    hub region from outside it, and one that was already sitting there did not.
  * **A ball that passed over the hub.** It vanishes behind the structure and
    comes back the other side, often with a new track id. This is the one that
    cannot be settled in the moment, so a vanish inside a hub is held
    `reacquire_frames` before it is allowed to count, and a new track appearing
    near where it went cancels it.

That last rule is the same shape as `scoreboard.clean_series` demanding two
consecutive reads before it believes a large jump: commit late, and let the
next few frames withdraw it. Here it costs a fraction of a second of latency,
which is nothing against being confidently wrong about a score.

## Frame rate matters here, and it is why detect.py does the opposite

`detect.py` throws fuel track ids away, because it runs over frames sampled at
3 fps where a ball moves further between samples than its own width and a track
means nothing. This runs on a live camera at its native rate, where a ball is a
few pixels from where it was and tracking it is the whole method. Same class in
the same weights, opposite decision, for the same reason: what the frame rate
can support.

## When this IS the score

At a scrimmage there is no Field Management System, so nothing else is
counting and there is no better number to defer to. That is the case this was
built for, and it is why `field.py` exists: a count is not a scoreboard until
it has a match clock and a referee who can correct it. `run.py count --scoreboard` is the whole thing.

Where a real scoreboard does exist -- a broadcast with a burned-in counter --
read that instead. It is the field's own arithmetic and this is not.

Either way the limits are the same and worth saying plainly, because at a
scrimmage nothing else will catch them: it cannot see a ball occluded for its
whole flight, and a hub region that is slightly wrong costs real balls.

Which is why `run_source` times itself. The failure that matters is the silent
one -- a box too slow for the camera misses balls between the frames it does
see, and the score is simply low, with no gap and nothing odd about it. There
is no second number anywhere to disagree with it, so it has to say so itself.
